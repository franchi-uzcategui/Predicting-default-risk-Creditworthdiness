# Predicting-default-risk

Due to a financial scandal linked to a competitor bank, fortunately, this week a small bank received 500 loan applications, representing 300 applications more than their usual demand. We need to calculate how many new creditworthiness customers can get a loan this week.
First, we created several models -Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Forest, and Boosted. Second, we selected for predicting the Forest model and applied it to the 500 new customers. Although the four models examined are biased to Creditworthy, we used the overall Accuracy value to select the highest value. Being it the Forest Model a prudent solution to this business problem.
Finally, according to the model score that included the whole population, there are 406 individuals Creditworthy and 94 Non-creditworthy.
